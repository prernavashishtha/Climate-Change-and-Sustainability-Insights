# Climate Change and Sustainability Insights

## Overview
This repository provides an analysis of key climate change and sustainability data, focusing on CO2 emissions, global temperature trends, sea level rise, and carbon emissions by sector from 1990 to 2024. The data is visualized through interactive charts and used to highlight the environmental impact of human activity.

## Data and Visualizations:
The following data trends are included:
- **CO2 Emissions by Country:** Shows the CO2 emissions of various countries over the years.
- **Global Temperature Trends:** Displays changes in global temperatures from 1990 to 2024.
- **Sea Level Rise:** Tracks the rise in sea levels over the years.
- **Carbon Emissions by Sector:** Breakdown of carbon emissions by different sectors like transportation, industry, and agriculture.

## How to Use:
1. **Download the Files:**
   - **Sustainability Tracker (Excel):** This file contains the raw data and pre-generated charts. Use it to explore trends in CO2 emissions, temperature changes, and more.
   - **Charts Folder:** Contains images of visualized data for each category.

2. **Explore the Data:**
   - Open the **Sustainability Tracker** in Excel or Google Sheets to see the data and the automated CO2 savings calculations.
   - Use the built-in charts to explore the visual representation of the trends.

3. **Analyze the Insights:**
   - View trends over time and identify key patterns that could inform actions to mitigate climate change impacts.

## Features:
- **Track Climate Data:** Comprehensive tracking of global temperature changes, CO2 emissions, sea level rise, and sector-based carbon emissions.
- **Visualizations:** Clear charts and graphs to display trends and impacts of climate change.
- **Sustainability Tracker:** A tool for calculating and understanding CO2 savings from resource use.
